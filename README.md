# GI-MeltOnset
Colab notebook for BGC-Argo NetCDF profiles: flags under-ice periods, detects melt onset (near-surface T-Tf threshold + salinity freshening) and phytoplankton GI (filtered CHL extrema + growth-rate heuristic, with fallback). Exports out.nc and saves per-float diagnostics for plotting.

This notebook aims to work in the direction of this incomplete repository of HagueVichi(2020): https://github.com/MarkHague/BGC-ARGO-Tools/tree/main
